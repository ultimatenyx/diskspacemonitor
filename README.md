# diskspacemonitor
A micro disk space monitor to send alerts via email.

This is a short and quick monitor created for linux as well as windows but basically plannned to be used with linux environments. 

The plan is to run a job to run this file every 4 hours so that we have 4 hours to action this email and do some disk cleanup.
